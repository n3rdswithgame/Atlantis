# Atlantis

Atlantis is an GBA emulator I am working on. It is not ready for release so the master branch is kinda barebones right now. There is a lot more information on the develop branch.

(copied from devlop branch as its important to reiterate here)

## Note on Piracy
This project by no means encourages or even condone the use of piracy. You are encouraged to write your own homebrew applications, or if you want to try games then please dump them yourselves (pleanty of methods online on how to do that). Currently there is no high level emulation of the bios, so that is also required and again please [dump it yourself](https://gist.github.com/MerryMage/797c523724e2dc02ada86a1cfadea3ee).

Please do not just go into google and search for roms or the GBA bios.

## License
This project is currently licensed under the MIT license. There is a potential I will add 2nd more restrictive license so it will be dual MIT and ___. If for whatever reason you might want to use this under a different license, email me (not gonna post it here because of webcrawlers, but its in the git log).
